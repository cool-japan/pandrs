## Refactoring Approach

### 1. Code Organization through Module Division

Current `dataframe.rs` (about 2500 lines) will be refactored with the following approach:

1. **Separation by Functionality**: Utilize implementation in `split_dataframe/` directory divided by functionality
   - Column operations: `column_ops.rs`
   - Data operations: `data_ops.rs`
   - Index operations: `index.rs`
   - I/O: `io.rs` ✅
   - Join operations: `join.rs` ✅
   - Statistical processing: `stats.rs`
   - Grouping: `group.rs` ✅
   - Column view: `column_view.rs`
   - Core functionality: `core.rs`

2. **Gradual Approach**:
   - Migrate in stages by functional blocks, not all at once
   - Run tests at each stage to verify functionality
   - Commit after certain functionality is migrated to record progress

3. **Token Limit Consideration**:
   - Consider the 25000 token limit of AI tools (Claude Code)
   - Limit functional blocks processed at once

### 2. Specific Implementation Procedure

#### Phase 1: Streamlining `dataframe.rs`

1. **Maintaining Basic Data Structure Definitions**:
   - Keep structure definitions and basic constructors in `dataframe.rs`
   - Keep basic accessor methods in `dataframe.rs`

2. **Next Migration Plan**:
   - ✅ I/O functionality (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Excel, SQL) → `split_dataframe/io.rs`
   - ✅ Grouping and aggregation → `split_dataframe/group.rs`
   - ✅ Join operations → `split_dataframe/join.rs`
   - ✅ Data transformation (melt, append) → `split_dataframe/data_ops.rs`
   - ✅ Column operations (addition, deletion, renaming, value retrieval) → `split_dataframe/column_ops.rs`
   - ✅ Index operations (setting, retrieval, selection) → `split_dataframe/index.rs`
   - ✅ Row operations (filtering, selection, head, tail, sample) → `split_dataframe/row_ops.rs`
   - ✅ Statistical processing → `split_dataframe/stats.rs` (already fully implemented)
   - ✅ Function application (apply, applymap, par_apply) → `split_dataframe/apply.rs`
   - ✅ Parallel processing (par_filter) → `split_dataframe/parallel.rs`
   - ✅ Selection operations (select, filter_by_indices) → `split_dataframe/select.rs`
   - ✅ Aggregation operations (sum, mean, count, min, max) → `split_dataframe/aggregate.rs`
   - ✅ Sort operations (sort_by, sort_by_columns) → `split_dataframe/sort.rs`
   - ✅ Serialization operations (to_json, from_json) → `split_dataframe/serialize.rs`
   - Next candidates:
     - Descriptive accessor methods (describe, info) → `split_dataframe/describe.rs`

3. **Migration Process**:
   - Implement each functionality in corresponding file in `split_dataframe/`
   - Remove corresponding implementation from `dataframe.rs` or replace with simple delegation
   - Identify and extract common utilities

#### Phase 2: Testing and Optimization

1. **Test Enhancement**:
   - Confirm and add tests for each module
   - Verify edge cases
   - Measure performance

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize interactions between modules
   - Identify and improve critical paths
   - Reduce memory usage

### 3. Code Quality Improvement

1. **Consistent Design**:
   - Define clear module boundaries and responsibilities
   - Consistent error handling
   - Maintain type safety

2. **Documentation**:
   - Clarify purpose and responsibility of each module
   - Document public APIs and inter-module interfaces
   - Update code examples

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Enhanced Maintainability**:
   - Division of a 2600-line huge file into multiple smaller modules
   - Clarification of responsibilities by functionality, easier to understand
   - Localization of impact range from changes

2. **Enhanced Extensibility**:
   - New functionality additions concentrated in specific modules
   - Clear dependencies between modules

3. **Performance Improvement**:
   - Easier optimization by functionality
   - Reduced memory usage

4. **Enhanced Code Reliability**:
   - Improved test coverage
   - Consistent error handling

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing APIs
2. **Gradual Implementation**: Migrate in stages by functional blocks, not all at once
3. **Test-Driven**: Run tests after each change to verify functionality
4. **Token Limit Handling**: Consider the 25000 token limit of AI tools (Claude Code) by using a split approach

## Schedule

1. **Initial Evaluation and Planning**: 1 week
2. **Phase 1 (Functionality Migration)**: 2-3 weeks
3. **Phase 2 (Testing and Optimization)**: 1-2 weeks
4. **Final Review and Adjustment**: 1 week

Total: About 5-7 weeks

This refactoring plan will significantly improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase, making future extensions and functionality additions easier.
