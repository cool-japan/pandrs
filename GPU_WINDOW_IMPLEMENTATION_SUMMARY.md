# GPU-Accelerated Window Operations Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive GPU acceleration for window operations in PandRS, providing significant performance improvements for large-scale data processing while maintaining full compatibility with existing JIT and CPU-based implementations.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. GPU Window Operations Architecture (`src/dataframe/gpu_window.rs`)

**Core Features:**
- **Hybrid GPU/JIT/CPU Strategy**: Intelligent selection between GPU, JIT compilation, and standard CPU based on data size and operation complexity
- **CUDA Integration**: Full integration with existing CUDA infrastructure using cudarc
- **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful fallback to CPU implementations when GPU is unavailable or not beneficial
- **Memory Management**: Smart GPU memory allocation with configurable thresholds and caching

**GPU-Accelerated Operations:**
- Rolling mean, sum, standard deviation, variance
- Rolling min, max (with higher thresholds due to memory-bound nature)
- Expanding mean, sum, standard deviation, variance
- Exponentially Weighted Moving (EWM) operations
- Support for custom window sizes and parameters

### 2. Performance Optimization Features

**Intelligent Thresholds:**
- Default GPU threshold: 50,000 elements
- Operation-specific thresholds:
  - Complex operations (std, var, EWM): 25,000 elements
  - Memory-bound operations (min, max): 100,000 elements
  - Sorting operations (median, quantiles): 150,000 elements

**Memory Efficiency:**
- GPU memory usage monitoring and limits
- Memory allocation success tracking
- Transfer time optimization
- Cache management for repeated operations

**Statistics and Monitoring:**
- Comprehensive performance tracking (GPU vs CPU execution times)
- Memory allocation success rates
- Transfer efficiency measurements
- GPU usage ratio analysis
- Real-time speedup calculations

### 3. Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**Seamless API Integration:**
```rust
// Standard window operations
let result = df.rolling(20).mean()?;

// GPU-accelerated window operations
let gpu_context = GpuWindowContext::new()?;
let result = df.gpu_rolling(20, &gpu_context).mean()?;
```

**JIT Compatibility:**
- Extends existing JIT window operations
- Maintains JIT caching and compilation statistics
- Combined performance monitoring for JIT + GPU

**Configuration Options:**
